# Can I Require Extension

This extension simply wraps the public [Can I Require](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/canirequire) site to allow you to discover which modules you can require in Auth0 extensibility points that are specific to your version of the Webtask sandbox. This is particularly useful for Auth0 Appliance Customers.

You can install this extension by going to **Manage > Extensions**. Click on the `Create Extension` button and enter `https://github.com/auth0-extensions/canirequire-extension` in the Modal and follow the prompt. Once installed, you'll be able to access the extension as you would with any other installed extension.
